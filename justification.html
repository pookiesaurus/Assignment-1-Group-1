      <h1>Project Justification</h1>
      <h3>Homepage (Index.html)</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage is structured to allow for easy navigation across the 5
        main pages + The justification page. This page was designed to emphasise
        the 5 game pages by using anchor icons (Using <'a'> to connect each html
        file and "img" embedded within the anchor), and css elements (a:hover +
        simple size editing) to be the focal point of the page. Each button has
        its own div (.gamelink), to allow for structuring adequate spacing
        inside the main buttons div (.gamebox). The justification link is placed
        as an hyperlink anchor in a footer to be viewed last. Names are placed
        below each icon for context (within the .gamelink div).
      </p>

      <h2>cross-page choices:</h2>
      <h3>Navigation Bar (Fixed position)</h3>
      <p>
        We chose to include a consistently structured navigation bar across all
        5 game pages to allow the user to easily switch between the game,
        homepage & justification pages. In CSS, properties of colour, font size,
        float, text-align and padding were used to format the navigation bar,
        using the class selector. The ‘active’ selector was also used to make
        the specified game button (e.g: 'Game 2') visually different from other
        non-active buttons. The :hover selector was also used to make the
        navigation bar more appealing through changing colours.
      </p>
      <article class="indivjust">
        <h2>Individual page choices:</h2>
        <h3>Darts page (phoebe.html) Phoebe</h3>
        <ul class="justpoint">
          <li>
            I used anchors to specific sections across the page to allow the
            user to more conveniently move between content. The buttons under
            the ‘darts’ title are connected as an unordered list to allow for
            a:hover effects.
          </li>
          <li>•	I coloured some sections (Footer + Section 2: Rules) to create more visual 
            division within the page, using a specific ‘class’ tag to separate it from the 
            original ‘dsect’ class css.</li>
          <li>
            I used an Iframe at the end of the webpage to allow the user to view
            other related darts content (youtube videos) easily within the site.
            Each externally sourced image / video is cited below using <’p’> or <’a’> text embeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            I organised the content of the page through "articles", and then
            into "sections" to allow a row flex direction of content for the
            viewer, especially for the rule unordered lists & dart board
            diagrams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used a table to showcase game modes through their components to be
            more easily understood by the viewer. Included a “top” button at the
            footer to allow users back to the jump segments conveniently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added in various sourced & created imagery to add interest to the
            page. 1] The Dartboard graphic in the ‘hero’ shot of the page, which
            is embedded into the background through css “background-image:”.
            Other images are embedded via <’img’> element, with alternative text
            to describe their purpose when the image is unable to be viewed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cricket Page (cricket.html) Jasleen</h3>
        <ul class="justpoint">
          <li>
            In the <'header'> element, using a unique class attribute, I’ve
            added contents of my header which in this case only included the
            name of the page, ‘cricket’. I have also directly underneath whilst
            using padding to create space, added a general image of cricket
            being played to span across the page as a way to separate ‘cricket’
            from the rest of the page as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <'h2'> tag was used to start the new sections of content for
            ‘Overview of the Game’ and ‘Rules’, with a distinct font and colour,
            pushed to the left.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a <'div'> tag with a class attribute of ‘flex-container’, in
            CSS the ‘display’ property had a value of ‘flex,’ to have the
            relevant content and image sit horizontally in order to make each
            section look more in union.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using an <'img'> tag, pictures were added including alternate
            (‘alt’) information describing the image in case the image cannot be
            displayed.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make the ‘Methods of Dismissal’ content more distinctive from the
            previous sections, I have used a green background colour and also
            aligned the heading to be in the centre rather than on the left
            under a new <'div'> tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using another <'div'> tag within, I have also embedded a youtube
            video using <'iframe'> tag. In CSS, that also includes adding a
            black border - a new visual element for the page for engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a <'div'> tag with a class attribute of ‘row’, in CSS the
            ‘display’ property has a value of ‘flex.’ This allowed for three
            images to sit horizontally next to each other - adding alt text and
            individual padding.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to show the characteristics of the three formats of
            cricket, I have used the <'table'> tag with 6 sets of
            <tr>
              tags including the first defining the three format names using the
              <'th'> tag. Remaining <'tr'> tag contains one <'th'> tag
              specifying the type of characteristic, followed by three <'td'>
              tags containing the content for each format for that row. In CSS,
              I have changed the font so the headings are more bold and clear to
              the user they are headings in comparison to the <'p'> content. I
              have added a green border around the table to have the table look
              more visually separate.
            </tr>
          </li>

          <li>
            I have also added another <'div'> tag that contains a hyperlink to
            the Australian National Team so the user can get information on the
            current team players. I have used the :hover selector and once the
            button is clicked, the background colour of the button is also
            changed too using the :active and :visited selectors in CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the <'footer'> tag that is outside of the <'body'> tag, I have
            included a footer at the bottom of the page. In CSS I have made the
            background black to be distinctive as well using padding and margin.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Valorant (ryan.html) Ryan</h3>
        <ul class="justpoint">
          <'body'> For this webpage, I used CSS to set the background colour at
          a warm neutral tone, and initialised it by removing all padding and
          margins.
          <li>
            nav> For the nav bar, I used a <'ul'> to list the pages. I then
            changed the display to flex using CSS to change the direction to
            row. I removed the bullet points for aesthetic reasons. I gave the
            list item for my page, GAME 3, the active class, and made that class
            a different colour, so that it is indicative of the current page the
            viewer is on. I made the nav bar’s position fixed, so that as the
            viewer scrolls through the page, the nav bar is still at the top and
            they can move to the other pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <'main'> I used the main container to contain the main content of
            the page. This includes all of the information about my game of
            choice, including the header, headings, sections and subsections.
            This is to differentiate it from the nav bar and footer, which do
            not fit in with the content of the page. I also included the in-page
            navigation bar within this section which uses anchor tags to take
            the viewer to the desired section within the page.
          </li>

          <li>
            <'header'> I put the title (as h1) and logo of the game into the
            header of the page. This is the introductory segment of the page
            which introduces the rest of the page’s contents, therefore it was
            placed in the header container. I used CSS to make the header
            container a flexbox, which allowed me to place the image and h1
            child elements side by side using the row flex direction.
          </li>

          <li>
            <'article'> The article container contains all of the text and
            images which relate to the game’s instruction. This includes any
            subsequent divs and subheadings. This is the biggest container in my
            webpage, as it contains all of the body text within it, as well as
            YouTube videos, using the iframe tag, images using the img tag, and
            tables using the table, tr, th, and td tags.
          </li>

          <li>
            <'section'> The section tag was used to separate the different
            sections under the article parent container. I used this for the
            three big sections of the page, “Gameplay”, “Game mechanics”, and
            “Skills”.
          </li>

          <li>
            <'details'> I used the details tag to create a widget for the agents
            subsection of the game mechanics section. I used its child element
            summary to create the text that could be toggled to open the details
            widget. This can be toggled to open and reveal a table which
            consists of four columns, detailing the profile pictures, names,
            roles and abilities of every agent in the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <'footer'> I used the footer container outside of the article and
            main tags, in order to give credits to myself. This was separate
            outside of the article and main tags as it was not part of the
            page’s main content, therefore it was the child of the larger body
            tag.
          </li>

            the page, positing as a visual information break in the website.
          </li>

          <li>
            Animation - animation was used for aesthetic purposes, displayed as
            a infinite logo slide section in the middle of the page. The logos
            consisted of related tennis tournaments. This was done by using
            @Keyframes and other CSS code to achieve the animation.

            In the header element, “plaintext” class was used in order to
            dictate the styling of the main title, and it was set to 70px in
            order to create a clear and impactful heading for the webpage
