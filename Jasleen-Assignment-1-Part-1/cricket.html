            <h2> OVERVIEW OF THE GAME </h2>
                <div1jas class = "oneflex-containerjas">
                    <p>The game of cricket involves two sides of 11 cricketers, played with a bat and ball. High levels of the game are typically  played on an oval including a rectangular strip in the middle of the oval, the pitch, approximately 20 metres by 3 metres wide. The wickets, two sets of three long sticks in the ground, are set at each end of the pitch. They also have horizontal small sticks laying on top of the wickets known as the bails. Each team bats and bowls; each turn being an "inning". Sides have one or two innings each, dependant on the factors of the game with the overall objective being to score more runs than the other teams. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aim of the bowlers, delivering the ball is to hit the wicket so the bails fall. This is one of many ways for the batsman to be dismissed. The bowler can only deliver six balls at one wicket in a row, completing an "over", for which then another bowler will complete their over whilst the batting side defends its wicket. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Two batsman are up at one time, and the batsman facing the delivered ball tries to hit the ball, defending the wicket. A defensive hit may defend the wicket but deny the opportunity for runs to be scored. An offensive hit allows for the opportunity for the pair of batsmen to run to their opposite ends of the pitch, gaining a run. Another way to gain runs is to hit the ball to the boundary lines. If the ball lands on the ground and then touches the boundary, four runs are gained and if the ball lands on the ground outside the boundary, then six runs are gained.

           <h2> RULES </h2>
           <div2jas class = "twoflex-containerjas">
            <img src="fielders.webp" alt="Australian team" width="35%"/>
            <p> There is one captain per team, two umpires - one standing behind the bowler's end of the wicket, other approximately 15 yards from the batman's crease. 
            <br>
            <br>
              A coin is conducted at the start of the match to determine which team will bat and bowl in the first innings.    
            <br> 
            <br> 
              There are three methods for an innings to be completed:
            <br>
            <br>
              1. When 10 batsmen have been dismissed.
            <br>
              2. When the captain of the batting team declares their innings to end before 10 batsman to be dismissed.
            <br>
            This is typically the case when the team has a large lead in runs, so by doing so ensure the other team completes their innings in the time allotted, preventing an automatic draw. 
            <br> 
              3. The allotted number of overs has expired.
            <br> 
            <br>  
            The results are recorded by the difference of runs or, if the batting side gains more runs than the other team, before all their batsman have been dismissed, then by the number of wickets
