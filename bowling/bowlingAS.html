                    <p>Bowling is a popular recreational activity played by people of all ages. </p>

                    <div class="intro">
                        <p>The term most commonly refers to ten-pin bowling, a competitive game in which players aim to
                            knock
                            down
                            a
                            set of ten pins using a bowling ball. Its history can be traced all the way back to ancient
                            Egypt,
                            where
                            participants rolled stones at different objects with the aim of knocking them over.
                            Nowadays,
                            the
                            most
                            popular form of the sport involves a narrow lane, pins, and a bowling ball of the player's
                            preferred
                            size and weight.
                            Bowling can be played individually or in teams, with leagues and tournaments held worldwide.
                            It
                            requires skill, technique, and strategy, as players must
                            adjust their approach based on lane conditions, ball weight, and pin placement.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Before beginning, it is important to choose the right weight of ball suitable
                                correct size to match your fingers, and a general to rule is that the ball should weigh
                                10% of
                                your body weight and the holes should fit snuggly around your fingers
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Hold the ball slightly to your side, with your bowling hand resting underneath and your
                                other hand on the bottom-side for support
                            </li>
                            <li>Approach the foul line with your back straight, shoulders squared, chest facing the
                                target and knees at a slight bend</li>
                            <li>
                                Lower the ball as you approach the foul line, feet slightly apart, ending with one foot
                                slightly behind (this would
                                be the foot opposite to your bowling hand)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It may be easiest to aim at the centre of the pin set-up, and once more comfortable,
                                work on aiming for the left or right side of the tip
                            </li>
                            <li>Finally, release the ball while maintaining a straightforward approach. Swing the
                                bowling ball smoothly back and then forward, releasing when your arm has moved as far as
                                you can reach</li>
                            <li>Keep your eye on the target while releasing the ball, with your thumb coming out first
                                and then your fingers</li>
                            <li>Now keep practicing and enjoy!</li>
