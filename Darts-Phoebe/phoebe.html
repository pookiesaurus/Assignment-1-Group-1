        <h2>Darts, Where do I start?</h2>
        <p class="maintext"> Darts, a competitive and casually enjoyed sport / game, is an indoor throwing game 
           where players through small projectiles (Darts) at a board to score points. Points are 
           collated by where specifically players hit – which are distributed individually across the 
           board, often within the goal to deduct a certain number of points within standard play (501).
        </p> 
        <p>
           Starting with darts, the main information to know is the rules, strategy and scoring of the
           game, then you can move onto playing different game modes & types, be it with friends

          <h2 class="contrast">Rules of Gameplay</h2>
          <p class="maintext">To play darts, some overall guidelines must be followed to ensure a fair, accurate and </br>
            safe game is conducted. This includes how players organise the game setup, </br>
            organisation of turn order and how each game should be operated.</p>
          <article class="content">
          <div class="textsplit">
          <h3> Play rules: </h3>
          <ul class="rules">
            <Li> To decide playing order: each player starts the game by throwing a single dart </br>
              each, with the throw l anding closest to the bullseye going first.</Li>
            <li> Each turn, traditionally a player is tasked throw three darts, unless the game </br>
               is won in less.</li>
            <li>Points may only be calculated for darts that reach the board at the end of a turn, </br>
               any darts that bounce or fall cannot be thrown again.</li>
            <li> If a player scores more than their remaining points required to win, their throw </br>
               ends and is scored zero.  </br>
                (E.g.: A player has 16 remaining and accidentally hit a 20 with their first dart, their </br>
                turn is ended, and they receive no points). </li>
            <li> Players must throw darts from a specific distance from the board (See setup </br>
               below)</li>
            <li> Darts games traditionally consist of 'Legs' (Rounds), where each game is resolved </br>
            after a set amount of 'legs' are won. </li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="imagesplit"> 
          <h3> Setup: </h3>
          <p>
            Dartboards should be set up within a safe and comfortable location for players, </br>
            optimally within an environment without any potential hazards – Spaces that are well lit, </br>
            well mounted and have protection on the floors, walls and other surfaces allow for </br>
            gameplay puncture-free. </p>

          <p> For official setup rules, the main requirements are as follows: </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li> The centre of the board (the Bullseye) should be 173cm high from the ground, or </br>
               137cm for players in wheelchairs.</li>
            <li> Players must throw from a clearly marked throwline, of a set distance of 237cm </br>
               horizontally from the board, for both standing and seated players. </br>
               (Extra) throwing space is recommended to be at least 152cm W x 3.35m </br>
               in size, to allow for safe distances between players, the board to protect </br>
               players and any items within the game-space.

          <h2>How Scoring works</h2>
          <p class="maintext"> Dartboards are divided into distinct sections </span> </br>
             – The Bulls (Inner and Outer), Individual </br>
             numbers, and doubling or treble sections. </p>
          <div class="diagram" >
          <div class="card">
          <h3> The Bulls </h3>
          <p> Includes both the main and outer Bullseyes – the circle points at the centre of the
             board. Hitting this area scores 50 points for the centre Bullseye and 25 for the outer bull
             ring. </p>
          </br>
          <img src="bulls.png" width="80%" Alt="Darts board diagram showing the Bullseyes">
          </div>
          <div class="card">
          <h3> Individual numbers </h3>
          <p> This includes all the wide spaces on the dartboard that are not within the narrow rings or 
             the bullseye. Hitting one of these sections will award you the number of points as 
             written in the corresponding section at the end of the board. These are 'Single-Scoring', 
             as they only award 1 multiple of the points allocated.</p>

      <div class="diagram">
        <div class="card">
          <h3> Double / Treble rings </h3>
          <p> These areas are the two rings seen in the middle and edge of the board. (Usually green & 
             red on the dart board). The outer ring – the Double – when hit grant the player a 
             multiplier of 2 on the points on the outer edge of the board. (Alike individuals, the base 
             point number is calculated from the outer edge numbers) </p>

          <p>The inner ring – The Treble – Score the player a multiplier of 3 to the corresponding 
             number on the outer edge board.</p>
          <p> Both Treble & Double rings only apply to the throw and dart that hits it. (Multipliers do 
             not count across multiple throws)</p>

          <h3> Bounced / Fallen darts </h3>
          <p> Failing to hit the board or darts that do not remain on the board at the end of the round
            do not score any points. Whoops!</p>
